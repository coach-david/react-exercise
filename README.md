# React Exercise

The exercise code can be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-exercise-start-pnkue).

Todo:

### Step 1 - Cleanup

- [] ‚ôªÔ∏è Cleanup the application by splitting App.js into reusable, small components
- [] ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor app.css to smaller CSS files, co-located with the relevant component. Tip: Use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for better isolation of your components.

### Step 2 - Make it work

- [] üö∏ Display the actual genre name in stead of the genre id
- [] ‚ú® Clicking the "+"-icon on a post should add the movie to the watchlist
- [] ‚ú® Selecting a "Sort by" option should sort the watchlist
- [] ‚ú® The "Genres" filter should display all genres found in the watchlist
- [] ‚ú® Clicking a genre in "Genres" should filter the watchlist, so only movies with the selected genre are displayed
- [] üíÖ Format the date to e.g. 19 sep 2019

### Step 3 - Make it dynamic
